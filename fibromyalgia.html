                    <p>A 48-year-old female high school English teacher presents to your continuity clinic with a chief complaint of “aching all over.” She reports that for the past year, she has felt a persistent, dull, aching pain in her neck, shoulders, back, and legs. “It feels like I have the flu, but it never goes away,” she states. The pain is present on both sides of her body, and she describes morning stiffness that lasts for about an hour but improves slightly as the day goes on. She is most concerned about her profound fatigue, which she rates as an 8/10. “I sleep for 8 hours, but I wake up feeling like I’ve run a marathon. I’m exhausted all the time.” She also reports difficulty concentrating in class and finding the right words, which she jokingly calls her “teacher fog”. Symptoms are worsened by stress, poor sleep, and cold, rainy weather.</p>
                    <p><strong>Past Medical History:</strong> Hypothyroidism (well-controlled on levothyroxine), migraine headaches (managed with sumatriptan as needed).</p>
                    <p><strong>Medications:</strong> Levothyroxine 75 mcg daily, Sumatriptan 50 mg PRN, daily multivitamin.</p>
                    <p><strong>Social History:</strong> Married with two teenage children. Denies smoking, drinks 2-3 glasses of wine per week. Reports significant stress from her job.</p>
                    <p><strong>Vitals & Physical Exam:</strong> BP 124/78, HR 76, T 98.6°F, BMI 26. Well-appearing, though fatigued. Musculoskeletal: Normal joint exam with full range of motion; no synovitis, swelling, or erythema. Diffuse tenderness to palpation over the trapezius, gluteal muscles, and medial knees bilaterally. Neurologic: Strength 5/5 throughout, reflexes 2+ and symmetric. Sensation intact.</p>

                    <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> (a) Fibromyalgia is the most likely diagnosis given the constellation of chronic widespread pain, fatigue, non-restorative sleep, and cognitive issues with a normal joint exam. (b) and (c) RA and SLE are critical mimics that must be ruled out, despite the lack of synovitis or rash on exam. (d) Her symptoms overlap significantly with hypothyroidism, and it's important to ensure her current dose is adequate. (f) The profound fatigue and potential for post-exertional malaise make ME/CFS a key consideration. (e) PMR is less likely given her age (typically >50) but remains a possibility to consider in the differential for widespread pain and stiffness.</p>

She reports her symptoms are unchanged. You decide to formally assess her using the 2016 ACR criteria. She reports pain in 10 areas over the last week (WPI=10). For the Symptom Severity Scale (SSS), she rates fatigue as 3 (severe), waking unrefreshed as 3 (severe), and cognitive symptoms as 2 (moderate). She also endorses headaches and depression over the last 6 months. Her SSS score is (3+3+2) + 2 = 10. Her scores (WPI ≥7 and SSS ≥5) meet the criteria for a fibromyalgia diagnosis.</p>

                    <p>A 34-year-old female graphic designer with a known history of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-alternating type) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) presents for evaluation of worsening pain and "brain fog." For the last 6-8 months, she has noticed a gradual onset of diffuse muscle aches, particularly in her upper back, neck, and hips. "It's not just my stomach anymore; now everything hurts," she says. She also reports significant cognitive difficulties, stating, "I'm missing deadlines because I can't focus, and I keep forgetting client feedback. It's really scaring me." Her sleep is poor, and she feels tired "down to my bones." Her anxiety has worsened, as she is convinced she has "something terrible, like lupus or MS."</p>
                    <p><strong>Past Medical History:</strong> IBS since her early 20s, GAD diagnosed 5 years ago.</p>
                    <p><strong>Medications:</strong> Dicyclomine PRN for abdominal cramps, Lorazepam 0.5 mg PRN for panic attacks (uses 1-2 times per week).</p>
                     <p><strong>Vitals & Physical Exam:</strong> BP 130/85, HR 88, T 98.7°F, BMI 22. Appears anxious and fatigued. Musculoskeletal: Normal joint exam. Widespread tenderness to palpation with light pressure over her back, arms, and legs. Abdomen: Soft, non-distended, with mild diffuse tenderness but no guarding or rebound.</p>
